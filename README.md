# Ansible Collection - rh.rosa

Role Name
=========

- create_rosa

    This playbook creates the following:

    - STS Roles and Policies required to install and support a ROSA STS Cluster
    - A ROSA STS PrivateLink Cluster
    - Operator Roles and Policies to operate a ROSA STS Cluster
    - OIDC provider to provide trust to Roles

- delete_rosa

    This playbook deletes all resources created by the **create_rosa** playbook


Requirements
------------

- An AWS IAM account with sufficient permissions to create a ROSA cluster [^1]

- Thoroughly read and understand the [Red Hat Openshift Service on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/what-is-rosa.html) documentation

- Complete the [ROSA getting started](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/rosa/getstarted) requirements

    You must complete some AWS account and local configurations to create and managed ROSA clusters.

- An offline OCM token

    This token is generated through the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. The purpose of this token is to verify that you have access and permission to create and upgrade clusters. This token is unique to your account and should not be shared.

- VPC and Subnets
    This play assumes there has been a VPC and Subnet(s) pre-created.

    The VPC and Subnet(s) must also pass a verification for egress traffic:
    
    ```rosa verify network --subnet-ids "${subnet-ids}" --region="${aws_region}" --role-arn="arn:aws:iam::${aws_account}:role/${role-name}"```

    The VPC and subnets must also be tagged with the following:
        
        Name: "Tag:Tenency"
        Value: "${cluster-name}
